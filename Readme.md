# Hangman Game Project

Attempt of writing a well-known game as python class object.

## Project Description

The project consists in creating Hangman class which in the end allows creating Hangman object for users to play. 
The class has a class attribute where you can find possible words a user may see when he/she plays. 
In the constructor part, with the help of random library a word gets picked and the user tries to guess a letter in each turn.
The user has total of 5 lives and tries to find all the correct letters of the picked word. 
If the users manage guessing all the words he/she will see a congratulation message and sees as well in how many attempts he/she got the end result. 
However, if the users loses all lives a game-over message will appear on the screen.
